Hello, and thank you for viewing my program, I will include videos which will show you why to use my program,
and how to run it using python. I will also add a file showing evidence that Python itself is not a virus.

For Downloading python I suggest downloading version 3.6.4 becuase this is where I tested the program, and I know it should work there

I have taken the time to comment about what every section of code does, to help prove this is not a virus.

To see the program working, view the functionallity video.

Thank you for downloading my program. I have spent about a month working on it, and many, many hours working on it.

If there are any bugs, please report them.

You will find a lot of files in this, most are presets you can use for the options in the program.
